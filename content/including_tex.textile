h1. Including TeX (WebTeX) math formula in slides

Everything line between :inlinetex and :endlinetex is treated as a TeX math formula

*Example:*

:inlinecode
:inlinewebtex
\alpha\beta\gamma
:endinlinewebtex
:end

*Result:*

:inlinewebtex
\alpha\beta\gamma
:end

h1. Ritex and WebTex

WebTeX is an adapation of the TeX math syntax which is designed for web page display.

Ritex is a nice little gem used to generate MathML from from WebTeX.

Ressources:
* "The WebTeX documentation":http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/software/webeq/currenthome/docs/webtex/toc.html
* "The Ritex documentation":http://ritex.rubyforge.org/

The flipside is that MathML doesn't always display properly in browsers :-(
