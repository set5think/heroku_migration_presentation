KaBOOM! migration to Heroku
===========================

* I gave this presentation at DCRUG in March, 2013.
* This presentation uses a pretty awesome tool by Dave Thomas of PragProg called codex.
* The final output has already been compiled, so you can just open html/all.html in any browser, but if for some reason you want to recompile it:

````
bundle install
rake all
open html/all.html
````
